                    is ARC? We are the Athletics & Recreation Centre. This is an exciting venture for our Algonquin Community.  This facility will provide our students with a place to break through perceptual barriers in a welcoming, safe, inclusive and inviting environment for students of all backgrounds, cultures and abilities to spark a movement.

                    is this going to cost me? This facility will be included in your activity fee. All fee-paying students can use and participate in all activities in the building. As for the facility, it will cost Algonquin College $48.8 million.
